The game is based on the Popular [**Legend of Zelda**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)),
and will have enemies that move and attack using a simple AI.

We are very interested in learning the background of game-making, how some simple game-mechanics
work, and how that is put into practical use.

The game that we want to make, is an [**action-adventure game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game),
with 2D-graphics, items that the player-character (PC) will use to solve puzzle (depending on time
limitations) or alternatively attack with.

The graphics are to be handled by using a [**texture-atlas**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas).
And in the end will have a similar
look to [**this**](https://i2.wp.com/sourcegaming.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Zelda-NES-Screenshot-1.png?ssl=1).

It will be developed using Java and the standard library of Java. The GUI will be built using Java
Swing. To add multiplayer capabilities, we want to use ReactiveX.

No game-engine will be used, so that we can learn how the game-engine itself works, by solving the
problems that it has to. For example how player-interactions work, how this is rendered to the
screen, how resources are handled and such questions.

The game will contain at least one Character, several Enemies and enemy-types, dungeon-rooms to move
through. There will also be for example obstacles to traverse.
